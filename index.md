Everything Starts Somewhere

## First Steps

Please start by reading the [Documentation](docs/README.md){:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install](docs/install.md){:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Upgrade](docs/upgrade.md){:.heading.flip-title} --- You can skip this if you haven't used Hydejack before.
* [Config](docs/config.md){:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.
